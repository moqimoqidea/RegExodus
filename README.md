# RegExodus
Regular expression lib; portable across Java variants (including GWT)

This is a modified fork of JRegex, by Sergey A. Samokhodkin, meant to improve
compatibility with Android and GWT. This builds off Ed Ropple's work to make
JRegex Maven-friendly. This fork started with Ed Ropple's copy of jregex 1.2_01
([available on GitHub](https://github.com/eropple/jregex)).

You can get the original jregex at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jregex
